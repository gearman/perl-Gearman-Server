        * Don't get stuck in the wakeup loop. Dummy.

1.10 2009-10-04

        * Read client input more aggressively. Speed improvement.

        * Add text commands 'jobs' and 'clients' which give information allowing you to trace
          jobs from clients to workers while they are running.

        * Flush buffers to client on EOF (assume half-closed). This makes things like netcat
          work better as a way to speak text protocol to the gearmand.

        * Add command-line option to adjust a delay before more workers are woken up.
          This acts as an anti-starvation mechanism in case of lower wake up counts.
            -Default is .1 seconds, formerly this option was not needed because all workers
             were woken up at the time of job submission.

        * Add command-line option to adjust number of workers to wake up per job injected.
            -Default is 3, formerly was -1 (wake up all as fast as possible)

        * Add command-line option to change the number of sockets accepted at once per
          listener socket.
            -Default is now 10, formerly used to be 1.

        * Add exceptions passing support to gearman server classes, using new options
          support.

        * Add options support to server clients, so they can subscribe to newer protocol
          features.

        * Change listening socket to be a real Danga::Socket subclass, this allows
          pausing for a period of time when we run into accept errors. This will
          fix the problem of gearmand spinning 100% cpu in those cases.

        * Make gearmand a little more vocal about socket accept errors.

        * add fast read concept to server reading from client codepath. This drastically
          improves performance of jobs over 1k in size.

        * fix in-process client and start_worker method calls to use non-blocking
          sockets like they should.

1.09 2007-05-09

        * make start_worker (for making worker child processes), return
          the pid in scalar context, or ($pid, $conn) in list context

        * make the text command "status" show functions which have
          registered workers, even if nothing is pending for that func.

1.08 2007-05-01

        * let start_worker take a coderef for the exec, not just an $exe name

1.07 2007-05-01

        * fix up bug in Gearman::Server:  we set OtherFds, instead of adding with
          Danga::Socket->AddOtherFds, blowing away other watched fds.

        * Add Gearman::Server->to_inprocess_server that returns a socket connecting to
          the server object, we can then use this socket with a Gearman::Client::Async
          object to run clients and servers in the same thread.

        * Add ability for workers to be launched as sub processes of the
          gearmand, using a duped socketpair for communication.

1.06 2007-04-25

        * split up the monolithic gearmand script (which had classes, but
          all internally), into separate files per class, and also make
          a new Gearman::Server class, so Gearman servers can be embedded
          into other processes.  (running Gearman router inside Perlbal,
          MogileFS, DJabberd, etc... then having child processes be workers)

1.05

        * add --pidfile=/path/file.pid option and document the command
          line options (Ask Bjoern Hansen)

1.04 2007-02-20

        * Add maximum jobqueue size feature, with a test.

1.03 2006-09-25

        * "version" text command

        * weakref client connections in listeners list so they go away.
          still wondering why the jobs holding them lasted so long.
          or was it a loop?  time will tell.  go gladiator.

1.02  2006-09-20

        * Devel::Gladiator support for tracking elusive memory leak

        * support for "shutdown" and "shutdown graceful" commands,
          the latter of which immediate stops listens, and exits
          when convenient

1.01  2006-07-01

        * Artur Bergman backed out some changes seconds before I did
          the 1.00 release.  this puts them back in.

1.00  2006-07-01

        * the get-it-on-CPAN-finally release.  but forgot this changes
          entry.

0.30  2006-06-27

        * fix memory leak with sleepers list.  change it from list to hash
          so there can't be dups, as there were before, when a worker
          could do multiple functions.
